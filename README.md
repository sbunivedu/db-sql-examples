## Kings and Queens
Consider a database for kings and queens of England:
* Kings(name, nickname, house, beginReign, endReign): kings have unique names,
  e.g. using a Roman numeral to distinguish them, e.g., 'Edward I' or
  'Edward II', or in a few cases using their nickname, e.g., 'Edward the
  Confessor'. The attribute 'nickname' is an additional appelation, if they have
  one and it is not used in their name to distinguish them, e.g., 'The Unready'.
  The value of nickname is NULL if there is no nickname. The attribute house is
  the dynasty, e.g., 'Tudor'. Attribute beginReign and endReign are integers,
  the first and last years, respectively, that the king or queen was on the throne.
* Parents(child, parent): both attributes are the names of kings or queens, with
  the obvious connection that the first is a child of the second.

24. Several times in British history, kings or queens have deposed one another,
    so that their reigns overlapped. Find all such pairs, listing the pairs in
    both orders; i.e., list both (A,B) and (B,A). However, be careful not to
    list pairs A and B where the only overlap is that A's reign ended in the
    same year that B's began, or vice-versa.
